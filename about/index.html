            <h1>About St. Mark's</h1>
            <p>Welcome to St. Mark's Matriculation Higher Secondary School, a secular co-educational institution, serving the student community in and around Chromepet for the past four decades. A matriculation school, St. Mark's adopts the best practices of different educational boards across India, ensuring that our students receive accurate, up to date educational information delivered in the most contemporary methods. The school firmly believes in ensuring that each child entrusted in its care, analyses, understands and achieves their individual potential. We here in St. Mark's do not believe in churning out mark machines, but are focussed on developing kind, intellectually enriched, focussed individuals, who are ready for all the challenges that lay await for them in their future.</p>

            <h2>From the Desk of Our Founder and Correspondent â€“ Mr. Prince Babu Rajendran</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Dear Parent,</p>
                <p>I thank you for choosing St. Mark's to partner you in your child's educational journey. Our institution which had its inception in the year 1983, with 6 students and 1 teacher, is entering its forty first year of operation with 1800 students and 200+ teachers in its rolls due to the trust and support of its students, teachers, parents, patrons and the locality of Chromepet. Here in St. Mark's we earnestly believe that education is not just about letters, numbers and marks. Education for us is preparing a child to face and overcome the innumerable internal and external challenges that will arise throughout their life. Our school is an avenue where a child discovers their interests and passion and determine their career path, while developing strong ethical principles. Markians are encouraged to ask questions, to understand rather than memorise, and to be in the constant pursuit of improving themselves. Our staff of caring, well qualified and involved teachers take steps to ensure that each child understands, acknowledges and achieves their potential. Sports, Co-curricular and Extra-curricular activities enable the wholistic development of our students. The prospectus that you are holding outlines what you can expect from the school and what the school expects from its prospective students. I once again thank you for considering our school.</p>

                    <h3>Teacher Accountability</h3>
                    <p>The fulcrum of a school lies in its teachers, who bring the vision of the management, the designers of the curriculum, the authors of the various textbooks to fruition. Therefore the need to keep our teachers updated with the latest in learning methodologies and guided through their various touch points with the children become important. Teachers undergo extensive workshops in the beginning of the year to streamline their capabilities with the school's expected performance and outcome. During the year, the Vice principals monitor a few classes of all the teachers in the department and share with them pointers and best practice, ensuring that the standard of teaching and coaching keep on improving within each department.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Four-Checkpoint System</h3>
                    <p>St. Mark's prides in passing on accurate, updated, error free information to the children. To this end a unique four checkpoint system has been created:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Checking of teachers' notes of lesson:</strong> All teachers have to submit their notes of lesson for all the classes they handle and get the approval form a representative of the management to ensure factual and grammatical accuracy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inspection of classwork:</strong> Random inspection of the classwork notebook and the text book is conducted in all classes across the various departments to ensure that the presentation of the children are upto the expectations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inspection of question paper:</strong> A question paper prepared in our school is expected to be of the highest standard. Every question paper consists the signatures of the subject teacher, the vice principal, and the person who typed it indicating an assurance that the question paper is error free.</li>
                        <li><strong>Answer paper evaluation:</strong> After the end of each examination random checking of the answer scripts of each subject across all classes is done before distribution of the answer scripts to the children.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This constant cyclical system of observation ensures that the teachers are constantly aware of the expectations of the school management and take the necessary steps to deliver on them.</p>
